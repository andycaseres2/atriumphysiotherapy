## Himani Goyal
### PT

Himani’s journey with physiotherapy started at an early age of 15, when her grandmother’s spinal injury at
the age of 55 made her bed ridden. Physiotherapy created a special place in her heart when the physiotherapist made her grandma mobile enough to be able to sit and feed herself and adapt to a new way of living against all hopes.

She has been a physiotherapist since 2005 when she finished her bachelors in physiotherapy .She pursued her masters in physiotherapy from 2006-2008 along with her successful practice.

She is a trained Mckenzie therapist, has done Cyriax courses empowering her strong diagnostic skills. She is a certified pelvic floor therapist . She is also a certified acupuncture specialist from AFCI and holds expertise in the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries along with spinal injuries, neurological conditions,women’s health, geriatrics and cardiorespiratory physiotherapy.

Her treatment approach involves a thorough and comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment followed by highly customised hands on treatments and education about maintenance of pain free state/condition. She focuses on prevention by optimizing posture and biomechanics of our body.

In the dynamic era of scientific innovation, her zeal to learn and explore the other side of the globe brought her from New Delhi to Calgary.

She strongly believes in Karma and does not miss any chance of expressing gratitude especially after working with spinal injury clients where she realized the value of every aspect of life, how a fraction of a second can change the scenario from roaring and sailing through the waves to struggle for a single breath. Her 15 years of physio experience in vast variety of settings and population helps her connect deeply with her patients.

Nature and adventure are her main interests.

When she is not working she is found playing with her two beautiful girls and enjoying their little garden and activities like arts and crafts, hiking, swimming, rafting, zip lining and yoga.
