      <h1>Physiotherapy</h1>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists are highly-educated experts in physical function,
        movement and mobility. They have advanced knowledge of how the human
        body moves and what stops it moving and use specialized hands-on
        treatment to restore, maintain and maximize optimal function and quality
        of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists assists, diagnose and treat physical symptoms and
        limited movement caused by injury, aging, disability, or medical
        condition. They help patients understand what is causing their
        condition, and work with them to restore, maintain and maximize
        movement, flexibility and physical independence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists develop customized treatment plans that help
        patients take back control. They teach patients how to restore, maintain
        and/or maximize movement, reduce pain, and manage any chronic symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists excel in the treatment of many conditions: back
        pain/injury, whiplash, pregnancy-related muscle/joint issues, urinary
        incontinence and vertigo to name a few. They also help patients manage
        symptoms of chronic conditions like arthritis and chronic pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists help patients who may have otherwise tried
        temporary (e.g., prescription drugs) or more invasive methods (e.g.,
        surgery) to manage their condition. They use individualized therapeutic
        exercise, manual therapy and other treatment techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through physiotherapy, many patients are able to recover unrestricted
        movement which promotes the kind of physical independence necessary for
        a normal lifestyle and work. When it comes to assessing and treating
        people with movement problems, the services of a physiotherapist are
        often essential.
      </p>
      <img src="'https://atriumphysiotherapy.com/images/stretching.jpg'" alt="">
      <h2>What Can I Expect During My First Appointment?</h2>
      <p>
        On arrival, you may be asked to fill out paperwork or complete medical history forms. Your physiotherapist will then conduct a detailed assessment of your problem or condition. This takes about 30-45 minutes and normally involves: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where you are having the problem</li>
        <li>How the problem started</li>
        <li>How the problem is affecting your ability to do daily activities</li>
        <li>Your past medical history</li>
        <li>Any medications you are taking</li>
        <li>Your physiotherapist may also need to ask additional questions</li>
        <li>depending on your problem or condition.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A detailed physical examination includes:</p>
      <li>Checking your posture</li>
      <li>Examining range of motion</li>
      <li>Testing muscle strength, ligaments, tendons, and nerves</li>
      <p>
        Your physiotherapist may also check your balance, walking or how much you can lift or carry. Once the assessment is complete, your physiotherapist will explain what is causing the problem and discuss a physiotherapy treatment program.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will then be asked to give consent to the treatment program. Before giving consent, make sure you fully understand the treatment plan. Ask if you need clarification. Your physiotherapist will explain the treatment plan in more detail.

        What is Functional Dry Needling/Intramuscular Stimulation (IMS)?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Dry Needling is a valuable, effective and efficient adjunct treatment
        to inactivate myofascial trigger points. It is an invasive procedure
        in which a thin solid filament sterile needle is used. Dry Needling
        involves insertion and repetitive manipulation of the needle in the
        myofascial trigger point. The purpose of this technique is to
        inactivate the myofascial trigger points by producing a local twitch
        response. This local twitch response then releases the shortened bands
        of muscle fibers. The result is muscle relaxation and pain relief.
        Eliciting this local twitch response is important for successful
        deactivation of the trigger point. No medication of any kind is
        injected. Inactivation of the trigger points can bring immediate
        relief of symptoms.
      </p>
      <img src="https://atriumphysiotherapy.com/images/ims1.jpg" alt="acupuncture" />
      <h2>What is Myofascial Trigger Point?</h2>
      <p>
        A myofascial trigger point is a hyperirritable spot in a muscle which
        is located in a taut (tight) band and is painful to touch. This
        hypersensitive spot or nodule (the “knot”), can give characteristic
        referred pain, referred tenderness and other referred symptoms in
        areas other than where the muscle is located. (Travel and Simons in
        Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual). Janet
        Travell, MD first described the existence of trigger points in the
        1940's.
      </p>
      <h2>Advantages of Dry Needling</h2>
      <p>
        The advantages of dry needling over other treatments are that we can
        treat parts of the muscle, and deeper layers of muscles, which our
        hands and fingers cannot reach. Also, this method is far superior in
        achieving a local twitch response over other manual techniques. In
        addition, there are no drugs used so we can treat many trigger points
        during each treatment.
      </p>
      <h2>How is this different from Traditional Acupuncture?</h2>
      <p>
        Dry Needling must not be confused with any type of acupuncture.
        Whereas acupuncture is founded on Traditional Chinese Medicine (Dry
        Needling is based on Western anatomical and physiological principles.
        It is founded by scientific concepts and it continues to evolve using
        the latest research.
      </p>
      <h2>Treatment Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Dry Needling is not a stand-alone treatment by itself. It is always
        done in conjunction with other manual and physical therapy treatments,
        such as exercises, postural training, education and other hands on
        techniques like soft tissue work and manipulation. Since full pain
        free range of motion is the ultimate goal of myofascial treatments, we
        teach the muscles the right away to work in their newly-gained pain
        free range to restore their normal function. It is important that you
        are an active participant in your own treatments and well being.
        Therefore you must follow through with your home exercise program
        which we will establish specifically for you.
      </p>
      <h2>Treatment Frequency</h2>
      <p>
        Typically, we will use Dry Needling once a week to inactivate the
        trigger points and you will have one or two more treatments that week
        to work on other aspects of your condition. There is no specific,
        predetermined number of treatments for patients with myofascial pain.
        Chronic conditions will require more treatments than acute conditions.
        In addition, the amount of treatments will also depend on concurrent
        other medical conditions, your compliance with the exercises, your age
        and physical condition.
      </p>
      <h2>Side Effects & Risks</h2>
      <p>
        The commonest side effects of FDN include temporary increase in pain which can last from a couple of hours to several days, followed by an expected improvement in the overall pain state. This increase in pain is mainly caused by the “twitching” of the muscles. It is also related to over activity of the shortened muscle bands that have not been released, or sometimes there is a temporarily increased spasm of the treated muscles. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The most serious risk with FDN is accidental puncture of a lung (pneumothorax). This can only happen if the needle is placed too closed to the chest/lung fields. If this were to occur, it may likely require a chest x-ray and no further treatment. The symptoms of shortness of breath may last for several days to weeks. A more severe puncture can require hospitalization and re-inflation of the lung. This is a rare complication, and in skilled hands it should not be a major concern. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Other less serious risks include infection and bruising: Any time a needle is used there is a risk of infection. However, your practitioner uses new, disposable and sterile needles, and is trained to the highest level of aseptic skin preparation and needle insertion technique. Therefore, infections are extremely rare. Injury to a blood vessel causing a bruise, and/or nerve injury may also occur. Bruising is a common occurrence and should not be a concern.

        Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese medicine involving the insertion of ultra-fine needles into specific points of the skin. These points of energy are located along 14 meridians, or channels, that cover the entire body. Using modern techniques, contemporary medical acupuncture is able to precisely stimulate nerves to modulate pain and other dysfunctions.

Graston Technique
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
-->    

    <div class="graston">
      <h1>Graston Technique</h1>
      <p>
        Graston technique is a form of instrument-assisted or augmented soft tissue mobilization (ASTM) that enables practitioners to improve scar tissue, fascial restrictions and range of motion. The theory behind this IASTM technique is that by using a tool to introduce microtrauma into an area of excessive scarring and/or soft tissue fibrosis, an inflammatory response will occur. In a 2017 Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation study, the authors describe that “Such inflammation restarts the healing process by removing the scar tissue and releasing adhesions, while also increasing blood and nutrient supply to the injured area and migration of fibroblasts.” (1b) 
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of tools helps to get to the root of the problem, but it’s also intended to reduce stress on the therapist’s hands. Graston technique allows a practitioner to get deep into the problematic tissue yet be sensitive to a patient’s level of pain tolerance. As the instruments are moved over the affected area and come in contact with adhesions, they help to break up scar tissue dysfunction and restrictions of the fascia.
      </p>
      <img src="https://www.atriumphysiotherapy.com/images/Graston.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        In time, this process can reduce or eliminate the adhered fibers, restoring range of motion and eliminating the associated pain. The aim and ideal outcome of Graston technique is to help transform your soft tissue injury into healthy functioning tissue once again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why does Graston technique aim to reduce scar tissue? Scar tissue is thick, dense tissue that appears after injury or trauma. It can limit your range of motion, cause pain and lead to dysfunctional movement. Graston technique aims to break up this scar tissue to interrupt and break the cycle of pain and dysfunction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Graston technique is never used completely on its own. The full treatment includes brief warm-up exercises, Graston technique treatment, followed by stretching and strengthening activities. Ice can also be a part of the follow-up portion of treatment if subacute inflammation (inflammation that lasts longer than acute inflammation but is not chronic) is present.
      </p>
      <p>
        This noninvasive method of healing known as Graston technique or instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) is used to treat all kinds soft tissue conditions, whether they are chronic, acute or post-surgical. You may have never heard of Graston technique before, but other people have, like the 431 professional and amateur sports organizations currently utilizing Graston technique on a regular basis. (1a) Clearly, some of the most physically active and frequently injured people on the planet must be feeling the relief of this healing technique!

Triton Spinal Decompression

    <h1>Triton Spinal Decompression</h1>

    <p>
      Spinal Decompression is a non-surgical and drug-free answer for disc related problems of the lumbar or cervical spine. Many people across the country and around the world have found relief from the pain associated with herniated discs, bulging discs, facet syndrome, degenerative joint disease, pinched nerves, and other spinal afflictions from decompression therapy. Spinal Disc Decompression uses computer-aided technology to apply gentle, non-surgical decompression to your spine which increases circulation into the spinal discs and joints, thus helping to relieve the symptoms that cause pain and dysfunction. 
    </p>
    <h2>How does Spinal Decompression work?</h2>
    <img src="https://www.atriumphysiotherapy.com/images/spinalBefore.png" alt="">
    <h3>The pumping action of the table does two things:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        As the table pulls on your spine it slowly stretches your spine and increases the space between the two spinal bones (the disc space). This creates a negative pressure or vacuum in the disc which helps to suck the disc back inwards and away from the nerve that is being pinched. Although the amount is very small each treatment, with consecutive treatments it creates more space for the nerve and decreases the size of the disc herniation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Secondly, the pumping action of the table sucks nutrients in and pushes nutrients out creating a nutrient exchange (imbibition). The increased level of nutrients in the disc allows the disc to have the nutrition it needs to speed up the healing process. Because discs don't have a large blood supply they do not get a lot of nutrients on their own. This is why most people don't just get better on their own, we typically cause as much damage to our discs in a day as we can heal with the natural imbibition. With spinal decompression we greatly increase the nutrients to the disc which provides the building blocks necessary for discs to heal more rapidly. Studies have shown that the disc space can increase 1-3mm over the treatment cycle that is provided. Although that seems a small amount it can have a large influence on the space needed to get pressure off of the sensitive nerves in the area.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Research on the effectiveness of Spinal Decompression:</h2>
    <p>
      A recent clinical study of 219 patients has shown that spinal decompression therapy provided a resolution of symptoms for 86% of the participants who completed their therapy, while 84% remained pain-free 90 days post-treatment. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several tables that perform non-surgical decompression of the spine. The following results were obtained from DRS/Inter-Discal Decompression (IDD) therapy, Vertebral-Axial Decompression and non-surgical Spinal Decompression Therapy. Although the concept of non-surgical Spinal Decompression therapy is similar in the DRS/VAX-D, please note that each table is a registered trademark and the following research may be specific to a specific decompression table/protocol employed. 
    </p>
    <img src="https://www.atriumphysiotherapy.com/images/spinalDecompression.jpeg" alt="">
    <h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
    <p>
      In a recent journal article in Orthopedic Technology Review titled Surgical Alternatives: Spinal Decompression, results showed that 86% of the 219 patients who completed the therapy reported resolution of symptoms while 84% of patients remained pain free 90 days post treatment. Physical examination findings showed improvement in 92% of the 219 patients, and remained intact in 89% of these patients 90 days after treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another article in Journal of Neurological Research reported that vertebral axial [spinal] decompression was successful in 71% of the 778 cases". The success rate varied from 73% for patients with a single herniated disc. It was 72% for people with multiple herniated discs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American Journal of Pain Management reported "good to excellent" relief in 86% of patients with herniated discs, with back pain and sciatica symptoms being relieved. Good to excellent results were also obtained in 75% of those with facet syndrome.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small non-randomized study in Anesthesiology News reported of the 23 patients who responded to therapy, 52% had a pain level of zero, 91% were able to resume their normal daily activities, and 87% were either working or were retired without having back pain as the cause of retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a small study to determine the long-term effects of vertebral axial decompression, the following results were obtained: "Among 23 patients, 71% showed more than 50% reduction in pain immediately after treatment, and 86% showed a 50% or better pain reduction at four years. After four years, 52% of respondents reported a pain level of zero. Thus, pain relief not only improved but lasted. This pilot study shows great promise for long term relief and new pain management techniques. 
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting study at the Rio Grande Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery compared the effects of 20 treatment sessions vs. 10 treatment sessions on chronic low back pain sufferers. The group receiving 20 treatments of decompression therapy reported a 76.5% with complete remission and 19.6% with partial remission of pain and disability. The second group, receiving 10 treatments of decompression therapy, reported a 42.9% rate of remission and 24.1% with partial remission. Failure rate was only 3.9% for those receiving 20 treatment sessions while it was 32.9% for those receiving only 10 sessions. Remission was defined as 90% or greater relief of pain, back to work without limitations, and abilities to carry out Activities of Daily Living (ADL's). Partial remission was defined as persistence of some pain but ability to carry out most ADL's and return to work with some restriction of duties, depending on the occupation. Failure rate was defined as no change in the level of pain and or/ADL.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see from the above referenced Clinical Trials, Spinal Decompression Therapy is an effective therapy for people experiencing Discogenic or Arthritic pain (pain arising from the disc or caused by various types of Spinal Arthritis). In addition, promising research suggests that the effects of Spinal Decompression Therapy can be a long-lasting solution to certain chronic back pain disorders. Although failure rates are relatively low, studies suggest that completion of prescribed treatments can reduce failure rates from 32.9% to 3.9%.

    <h1>Low Intensity Laser Therapy</h1>
    <img src="https://www.atriumphysiotherapy.com/images/clinical_laser.jpg" alt="Clinical effects of Laser Therapy">
    <p>
      Laser Therapy uses red and infrared light for the relief of pain, to accelerate healing and decrease inflammation. When the light source is placed against the skin, the photons penetrate several centimeters and get absorbed by the mitochondria, the energy producing part of a cell. This energy fuels many positive physiological responses resulting in the restoration of normal cell morphology and function. Laser Therapy has been successfully used to treat a broad range of medical conditions, including musculoskeletal problems, arthritis, sports injuries, post-surgical wounds, diabetic ulcers and dermatological conditions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike many pharmacological treatments that mask pain or only address the symptoms of disease, Laser Therapy treats the underlying condition or pathology to promote healing. This means that the treatments are effective and the benefits of Laser Therapy are long lasting.

  <h1>K-Tape</h1>
  <p>
    KT Tape® is applied along muscles, ligaments, and tendons (soft tissue) to provide a lightweight, external support that helps you remain active while recovering from injuries.*
  </p>
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
    When an area of the body is injured through impact or over-use, the lymphatic fluid builds up causing inflammation and swelling. This accumulation of lymphatic fluids may cause increased pressure on muscles and tissue which can cause significant discomfort or pain*.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is believed that when applied correctly, KT Tape lifts the skin, decompressing the layers of fascia, allowing for greater movement of lymphatic fluid which transports white blood cells throughout the body and removes waste products, cellular debris, and bacteria.

<h1>Massage Therapy</h1>
<p>
  Massage Therapy involves gentle hands-on manipulation of the soft tissues of your body. Therapeutic massage focuses on your muscles, connective tissue, tendons, ligaments and joints. Atrium Physiotherapy Registered Massage Therapists manipulate your muscles and other soft tissues of the body with varying degrees of pressure and movement. This helps to relieve pain and tension. If done soon enough after accidents involving trauma and injury, massage can greatly reduce the development of painful muscular patterning.
</p>
<p>
  Massage Therapy is more than a period of relaxation, the therapeutic message helps diminish physical problems caused by stress, back pain, loss of energy, insomnia, etc. Massage can bring physical, mental and emotional changes. The benefits can vary from individual to individual.
