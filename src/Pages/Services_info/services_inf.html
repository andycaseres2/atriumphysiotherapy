      <h1>Physiotherapy</h1>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists are highly-educated experts in physical function,
        movement and mobility. They have advanced knowledge of how the human
        body moves and what stops it moving and use specialized hands-on
        treatment to restore, maintain and maximize optimal function and quality
        of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists assists, diagnose and treat physical symptoms and
        limited movement caused by injury, aging, disability, or medical
        condition. They help patients understand what is causing their
        condition, and work with them to restore, maintain and maximize
        movement, flexibility and physical independence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists develop customized treatment plans that help
        patients take back control. They teach patients how to restore, maintain
        and/or maximize movement, reduce pain, and manage any chronic symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists excel in the treatment of many conditions: back
        pain/injury, whiplash, pregnancy-related muscle/joint issues, urinary
        incontinence and vertigo to name a few. They also help patients manage
        symptoms of chronic conditions like arthritis and chronic pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists help patients who may have otherwise tried
        temporary (e.g., prescription drugs) or more invasive methods (e.g.,
        surgery) to manage their condition. They use individualized therapeutic
        exercise, manual therapy and other treatment techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through physiotherapy, many patients are able to recover unrestricted
        movement which promotes the kind of physical independence necessary for
        a normal lifestyle and work. When it comes to assessing and treating
        people with movement problems, the services of a physiotherapist are
        often essential.

      <h2>What Can I Expect During My First Appointment?</h2>
      <p>
        On arrival, you may be asked to fill out paperwork or complete medical history forms. Your physiotherapist will then conduct a detailed assessment of your problem or condition. This takes about 30-45 minutes and normally involves: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where you are having the problem</li>
        <li>How the problem started</li>
        <li>How the problem is affecting your ability to do daily activities</li>
        <li>Your past medical history</li>
        <li>Any medications you are taking</li>
        <li>Your physiotherapist may also need to ask additional questions</li>
        <li>depending on your problem or condition.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A detailed physical examination includes:</p>
      <li>Checking your posture</li>
      <li>Examining range of motion</li>
      <li>Testing muscle strength, ligaments, tendons, and nerves</li>
      <p>
        Your physiotherapist may also check your balance, walking or how much you can lift or carry. Once the assessment is complete, your physiotherapist will explain what is causing the problem and discuss a physiotherapy treatment program.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will then be asked to give consent to the treatment program. Before giving consent, make sure you fully understand the treatment plan. Ask if you need clarification. Your physiotherapist will explain the treatment plan in more detail. 
      </p>
