        <h1>Physiotherapy</h1>
        <p>
          Our physiotherapists are highly-educated experts in physical function,
          movement and mobility. They have advanced knowledge of how the human
          body moves and what stops it moving and use specialized hands-on
          treatment to restore, maintain and maximize optimal function and
          quality of life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our physiotherapists assists, diagnose and treat physical symptoms and
          limited movement caused by injury, aging, disability, or medical
          condition. They help patients understand what is causing their
          condition, and work with them to restore, maintain and maximize
          movement, flexibility and physical independence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our physiotherapists develop customized treatment plans that help
          patients take back control. They teach patients how to restore,
          maintain and/or maximize movement, reduce pain, and manage any chronic
          symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our physiotherapists excel in the treatment of many conditions: back
          pain/injury, whiplash, pregnancy-related muscle/joint issues, urinary
          incontinence and vertigo to name a few. They also help patients manage
          symptoms of chronic conditions like arthritis and chronic pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our physiotherapists help patients who may have otherwise tried
          temporary (e.g., prescription drugs) or more invasive methods (e.g.,
          surgery) to manage their condition. They use individualized
          therapeutic exercise, manual therapy and other treatment techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through physiotherapy, many patients are able to recover unrestricted
          movement which promotes the kind of physical independence necessary
          for a normal lifestyle and work. When it comes to assessing and
          treating people with movement problems, the services of a
          physiotherapist are often essential.

        <h2>What Can I expect During My First Apppointment?</h2>
        <p>
          On arrival, you may be asked to fill out paperwork or complete medical
          history forms. Your physiotherapist will then conduct a detailed
          assessment of your problem or condition. This takes about 30-45
          minutes and normally involves:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where you are having the problem</li>
          <li>How the problem started</li>
          <li>
            How the problem is affecting your ability to do daily activities
          </li>
          <li>Your past medical history</li>
          <li>Any medications you are taking</li>
          <li>
            Your physiotherapist may also need to ask additional questions
            depending on your problem or condition.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A detailed physical examination includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Checking your posture</li>
          <li>Examining range of motion</li>
          <li>Testing muscle strength, ligaments, tendons, and nerves</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your physiotherapist may also check your balance, walking or how much
          you can lift or carry. Once the assessment is complete, your
          physiotherapist will explain what is causing the problem and discuss a
          physiotherapy treatment program.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will then be asked to give consent to the treatment program.
          Before giving consent, make sure you fully understand the treatment
          plan. Ask if you need clarification. Your physiotherapist will explain
          the treatment plan in more detail.

          What is Functional Dry Needling/Intramuscular Stimulation (IMS)?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Dry Needling is a valuable, effective and efficient adjunct treatment
          to inactivate myofascial trigger points. It is an invasive procedure
          in which a thin solid filament sterile needle is used. Dry Needling
          involves insertion and repetitive manipulation of the needle in the
          myofascial trigger point. The purpose of this technique is to
          inactivate the myofascial trigger points by producing a local twitch
          response. This local twitch response then releases the shortened bands
          of muscle fibers. The result is muscle relaxation and pain relief.
          Eliciting this local twitch response is important for successful
          deactivation of the trigger point. No medication of any kind is
          injected. Inactivation of the trigger points can bring immediate
          relief of symptoms.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Myofascial Trigger Point?</h2>
        <p>
          A myofascial trigger point is a hyperirritable spot in a muscle which
          is located in a taut (tight) band and is painful to touch. This
          hypersensitive spot or nodule (the “knot”), can give characteristic
          referred pain, referred tenderness and other referred symptoms in
          areas other than where the muscle is located. (Travel and Simons in
          Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual). Janet
          Travell, MD first described the existence of trigger points in the
          1940's.
        </p>
        <h2>Advantages of Dry Needling</h2>
        <p>
          The advantages of dry needling over other treatments are that we can
          treat parts of the muscle, and deeper layers of muscles, which our
          hands and fingers cannot reach. Also, this method is far superior in
          achieving a local twitch response over other manual techniques. In
          addition, there are no drugs used so we can treat many trigger points
          during each treatment.
        </p>
        <h2>How is this different from Traditional Acupuncture?</h2>
        <p>
          Dry Needling must not be confused with any type of acupuncture.
          Whereas acupuncture is founded on Traditional Chinese Medicine (Dry
          Needling is based on Western anatomical and physiological principles.
          It is founded by scientific concepts and it continues to evolve using
          the latest research.
        </p>
        <h2>Treatment Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Dry Needling is not a stand-alone treatment by itself. It is always
          done in conjunction with other manual and physical therapy treatments,
          such as exercises, postural training, education and other hands on
          techniques like soft tissue work and manipulation. Since full pain
          free range of motion is the ultimate goal of myofascial treatments, we
          teach the muscles the right away to work in their newly-gained pain
          free range to restore their normal function. It is important that you
          are an active participant in your own treatments and well being.
          Therefore you must follow through with your home exercise program
          which we will establish specifically for you.
        </p>
        <h2>Treatment Frequency</h2>
        <p>
          Typically, we will use Dry Needling once a week to inactivate the
          trigger points and you will have one or two more treatments that week
          to work on other aspects of your condition. There is no specific,
          predetermined number of treatments for patients with myofascial pain.
          Chronic conditions will require more treatments than acute conditions.
          In addition, the amount of treatments will also depend on concurrent
          other medical conditions, your compliance with the exercises, your age
          and physical condition.
        </p>
        <h2>Side Effects & Risks</h2>
        <p>
          The commonest side effects of FDN include temporary increase in pain which can last from a couple of hours to several days, followed by an expected improvement in the overall pain state. This increase in pain is mainly caused by the “twitching” of the muscles. It is also related to over activity of the shortened muscle bands that have not been released, or sometimes there is a temporarily increased spasm of the treated muscles. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The most serious risk with FDN is accidental puncture of a lung (pneumothorax). This can only happen if the needle is placed too closed to the chest/lung fields. If this were to occur, it may likely require a chest x-ray and no further treatment. The symptoms of shortness of breath may last for several days to weeks. A more severe puncture can require hospitalization and re-inflation of the lung. This is a rare complication, and in skilled hands it should not be a major concern. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Other less serious risks include infection and bruising: Any time a needle is used there is a risk of infection. However, your practitioner uses new, disposable and sterile needles, and is trained to the highest level of aseptic skin preparation and needle insertion technique. Therefore, infections are extremely rare. Injury to a blood vessel causing a bruise, and/or nerve injury may also occur. Bruising is a common occurrence and should not be a concern.
