*Our services*

**Physiotherapy**

Our physiotherapists are highly-educated experts in physical function, movement and mobility. They have advanced knowledge of how the human body moves and what stops it moving and use specialized hands-on treatment to restore, maintain and maximize optimal function and quality of life.

Our physiotherapists assists, diagnose and treat physical symptoms and limited movement caused by injury, aging, disability, or medical condition. They help patients understand what’s causing their condition, and work with them to restore, maintain and maximize movement, flexibility and physical independence.

Our physiotherapists develop customized treatment plans that help patients take back control. They teach patients how to restore, maintain and/or maximize movement, reduce pain, and manage any chronic symptoms.

Our physiotherapists excel in the treatment of many conditions: back pain/injury, whiplash, pregnancy-related muscle/joint issues, urinary incontinence and vertigo to name a few. They also help patients manage symptoms of chronic conditions like arthritis and chronic pain.

Our physiotherapists help patients who may have otherwise tried temporary (e.g., prescription drugs) or more invasive methods (e.g., surgery) to manage their condition. They use individualized therapeutic exercise, manual therapy and other treatment techniques.

Through physiotherapy, many patients are able to recover unrestricted movement which promotes the kind of physical independence necessary for a normal lifestyle and work. When it comes to assessing and treating people with movement problems, the services of a physiotherapist are often essential.

**Needling/Intramuscular Stimulation (IMS)**

Dry Needling is a valuable, effective and efficient adjunct treatment to inactivate myofascial trigger points. It is an invasive procedure in which a thin solid filament sterile needle is used. Dry Needling involves insertion and repetitive manipulation of the needle in the myofascial trigger point. The purpose of this technique is to inactivate the myofascial trigger points by producing a local twitch response. This local twitch response then releases the shortened bands of muscle fibers. The result is muscle relaxation and pain relief. Eliciting this local twitch response is important for successful deactivation of the trigger point. No medication of any kind is injected. Inactivation of the trigger points can bring immediate relief of symptoms. 

What is Myofascial Trigger Point?
A myofascial trigger point is a hyperirritable spot in a muscle which is located in a taut (tight) band and is painful to touch. This hypersensitive spot or nodule (the “knot”), can give characteristic referred pain, referred tenderness and other referred symptoms in areas other than where the muscle is located. (Travel and Simons in Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual). Janet Travell, MD first described the existence of trigger points in the 1940’s.

Advantages of Dry Needling
The advantages of dry needling over other treatments are that we can treat parts of the muscle, and deeper layers of muscles, which our hands and fingers cannot reach. Also, this method is far superior in achieving a local twitch response over other manual techniques. In addition, there are no drugs used so we can treat many trigger points during each treatment.

How is this different from Traditional Acupuncture?
Dry Needling must not be confused with any type of acupuncture. Whereas acupuncture is founded on Traditional Chinese Medicine (Dry Needling is based on Western anatomical and physiological principles. It is founded by scientific concepts and it continues to evolve using the latest research.

Treatment Approach
Dry Needling is not a stand-alone treatment by itself. It is always done in conjunction with other manual and physical therapy treatments, such as exercises, postural training, education and other hands on techniques like soft tissue work and manipulation. Since full pain free range of motion is the ultimate goal of myofascial treatments, we teach the muscles the right away to work in their newly-gained pain free range to restore their normal function. It is important that you are an active participant in your own treatments and well being. Therefore you must follow through with your home exercise program which we will establish specifically for you.

Treatment Frequency
Typically, we will use Dry Needling once a week to inactivate the trigger points and you will have one or two more treatments that week to work on other aspects of your condition.

There is no specific, predetermined number of treatments for patients with myofascial pain. Chronic conditions will require more treatments than acute conditions. In addition, the amount of treatments will also depend on concurrent other medical conditions, your compliance with the exercises, your age and physical condition.

Side Effects & Risks
The commonest side effects of FDN include temporary increase in pain which can last from a couple of hours to several days, followed by an expected improvement in the overall pain state. This increase in pain is mainly caused by the “twitching” of the muscles. It is also related to over activity of the shortened muscle bands that have not been released, or sometimes there is a temporarily increased spasm of the treated muscles.

The most serious risk with FDN is accidental puncture of a lung (pneumothorax). This can only happen if the needle is placed too closed to the chest/lung fields. If this were to occur, it may likely require a chest x-ray and no further treatment. The symptoms of shortness of breath may last for several days to weeks. A more severe puncture can require hospitalization and re-inflation of the lung. This is a rare complication, and in skilled hands it should not be a major concern.

Other less serious risks include infection and bruising: Any time a needle is used there is a risk of infection. However, your practitioner uses new, disposable and sterile needles, and is trained to the highest level of aseptic skin preparation and needle insertion technique. Therefore, infections are extremely rare. Injury to a blood vessel causing a bruise, and/or nerve injury may also occur. Bruising is a common occurrence and should not be a concern. 

**Acupuncture**

Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese medicine involving the insertion of ultra-fine needles into specific points of the skin. These points of energy are located along 14 meridians, or channels, that cover the entire body. Using modern techniques, contemporary medical acupuncture is able to precisely stimulate nerves to modulate pain and other dysfunctions.

Whether there is a presence of a medical condition or not, everybody can benefit from acupuncture due to its homeostatic effects, which help the body regain balance and function at a more optimal level. Acupuncture has an array of health benefits; it can: 


    - Improve circulation
    - Improve digestion
    - Increase relaxation
    - Release natural pain killers
    - Increase energy
    - Relax shortened muscles
    - Reduce stress
    - Improve sleep and mood
    - Reduce both the intensity and perception of chronic pain
    - Strengthen the immune system
    - Stimulate the body’s “built-in” healing mechanisms


**Graston Technique ®**

Graston technique is a form of instrument-assisted or augmented soft tissue mobilization (ASTM) that enables practitioners to improve scar tissue, fascial restrictions and range of motion. The theory behind this IASTM technique is that by using a tool to introduce microtrauma into an area of excessive scarring and/or soft tissue fibrosis, an inflammatory response will occur. In a 2017 Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation study, the authors describe that “Such inflammation restarts the healing process by removing the scar tissue and releasing adhesions, while also increasing blood and nutrient supply to the injured area and migration of fibroblasts.” (1b)

The use of tools helps to get to the root of the problem, but it’s also intended to reduce stress on the therapist’s hands. Graston technique allows a practitioner to get deep into the problematic tissue yet be sensitive to a patient’s level of pain tolerance. As the instruments are moved over the affected area and come in contact with adhesions, they help to break up scar tissue dysfunction and restrictions of the fascia.

In time, this process can reduce or eliminate the adhered fibers, restoring range of motion and eliminating the associated pain. The aim and ideal outcome of Graston technique is to help transform your soft tissue injury into healthy functioning tissue once again.

Why does Graston technique aim to reduce scar tissue? Scar tissue is thick, dense tissue that appears after injury or trauma. It can limit your range of motion, cause pain and lead to dysfunctional movement. Graston technique aims to break up this scar tissue to interrupt and break the cycle of pain and dysfunction.

Graston technique is never used completely on its own. The full treatment includes brief warm-up exercises, Graston technique treatment, followed by stretching and strengthening activities. Ice can also be a part of the follow-up portion of treatment if subacute inflammation (inflammation that lasts longer than acute inflammation but is not chronic) is present.

This noninvasive method of healing known as Graston technique or instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) is used to treat all kinds soft tissue conditions, whether they are chronic, acute or post-surgical. You may have never heard of Graston technique before, but other people have, like the 431 professional and amateur sports organizations currently utilizing Graston technique on a regular basis.
